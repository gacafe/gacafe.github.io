Hola and thank you for taking the time to read about me. 

**I am currently looking for a role. Do you have one? Do you have ideas? Do you have advice? [Let's chat!](mailto:gala.camacho+website@gmail.com)**

I am always in search of interesting projects, particularly in the intersection of data + analytics, community building, and technical products that enhance equity in our society. If this is your jam, send me a message - I am always up for a digital coffee :)

My technical career (I was a teacher before!) has been in start-ups and scale-ups, developing analytics algorithms and visualisations, within multidisciplinary contexts.

Most of my work has been in analysing urban-systems, the way they impact our lives, and seeking ways to strategically change them to improve the lives of those within them - enabling organisation to make better decisions.

My experience has allowed me to work with data of many different kinds, to develop analytical frameworks from scratch, and to integrate analytics within work and organisational processes. It has enabled me to collaborate with subject matter experts across the range of the digital literacy spectrum, from elderly community members through to experienced engineers (software and otherwise!), to iteratively develop meaningful and practical analytics. 

I am experienced across a broad range of technologies, I enjoy being on tools as much as I enjoy setting the strategy and architecture of algorithms/analysis. I also enjoy managing people and have managed technical, non-technical, and hybrid teams. 

My last role was at [diagonalWorks](https://diagonal.works/), a company I cofounded and where I led Data Science. In February of 2025 we decided to wind down operations, a difficult decision, but the right one. We did a lot, we worked on some really exciting projects and learned so many lessons along the way. 

diagonalWorks in its various iterations was always value driven. We explored alternative governance and management models, from being steward owned, to operating under a flat structure, and allowing for fully flexible, remote work. We are really proud of our ambitions in this respect, to create a truly inclusive company culture. 

Before that, I was the Head of Analytics at a start-up in the civic and property tech space in Melbourne, Australia. There, I led the data and analytics strategy and implementation – from ideation through to production. I was in charge of the research and development of the core analytics IP as well as the delivery of bespoke analytics within special projects. 

In a previous career, I was a secondary school mathematics and science teacher, as such, I rely on many of the strategies I developed as a teacher to build analytics collaboratively and with purpose.

I have a masters in mathematics with a focus on operations research and discrete mathematics - I studied how to understand the mathematics behind logistical and operational type of problems. My masters research focused on evaluating ways to better schedule volunteers during an emergency in order to account for the different stages of an emergency activation, as well as the constraints set by the skills the different volunteers have and the skills necessary at every stage. 

Outside of work I like to spend time involved with organisations that try to elevate the voices of those who are marginalised – mostly in, but not limited to, technology.
