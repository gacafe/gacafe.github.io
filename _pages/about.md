Hola and thank you for taking the time to read about me. 

I co-founded and work as a Data Scientist at [Diagonal](https://diagonal.works/).
You can read more about why we started Diagonal [here](https://diagonal.works/post/how-it-started/). Recognising that technology is only a small part in the cog that is designing, evaluating and understanding cities, Diagonal aims to improve the quality of life in cities. I am excited and proud to be part of the [team](https://diagonal.works/about-us/) establishing and working at Diagonal! If you are keen to have a chat, think we can help you, or are just generally interested to hear more about us [please get in touch](mailto:hello@diagonal.works).

I am always in search of interesting projects, particularly in the intersection of data + analytics, community building, and technical products that enhance equity in our society. If this is your jam, send me a message - I am always up for a digital coffee!

Before my current role, I was the Head of Analytics at a start-up in the civic and property tech space in Melbourne, Australia. There, I led the data and analytics strategy and implementation – from ideation through to production. I was in charge of the research and development of the core analytics IP as well as the delivery of bespoke analytics within special projects. 

In a previous career, I was a secondary school mathematics and science teacher, as such, I rely on many of the strategies I developed as a teacher to **build analytics collaboratively and with purpose**.

My technical career has focused mostly on **working with non-technical people to develop analytics for measurement**, in many different contexts, to help inform decisions. I am experienced across a broad range of technologies, I enjoy being on tools as much as I enjoy setting the strategy and architecture of algorithms/analysis. I also enjoy managing people and have managed technical, non-technical, and hybrid teams. 

I have a masters in mathematics with a focus on operations research and discrete mathematics - I studied how to understand the mathematics behind logistical and operational type of problems. My masters research focused on evaluating ways to better schedule volunteers during an emergency in order to account for the different stages of an emergency activation, as well as the constraints set by the skills the different volunteers have and the skills necessary at every stage. 

Outside of work I like to **spend time involved with organisations that try to elevate the voices of those who are marginalised** – mostly in, but not limited to, technology.
