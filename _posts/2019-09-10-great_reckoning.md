Reading danah boyd's article [Facing the Great Reckoning Head-On](https://onezero.medium.com/facing-the-great-reckoning-head-on-8fe434e10630) was difficult. Reading about and discussing our privilege is an important step towards progress. If we can't recognise how the system has helped us, we stand no chance at dismantling it. 

"I am here today in-no-small-part because I benefited from the generosity of men who tolerated and, in effect, enabled unethical, immoral, and criminal men. And because of that privilege, I managed to keep moving forward even as the collateral damage of patriarchy stifled the voices of so many others around me. I am angry and sad, horrified and disturbed, because I know all too well that this world is not meritocratic. I am also complicit in helping uphold these systems.... I am here today because I learned how to survive and thrive in a man’s world, to use my tongue wisely, watch my back, and dodge bullets. I am being honored because I figured out how to remove a few bricks in those fortified walls so that others could look in. But this isn’t enough."
