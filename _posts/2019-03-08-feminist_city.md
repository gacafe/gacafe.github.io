Through the Neighbourlytics blog, I wrote [What would a feminist neighbourhood look like?](https://neighbourlytics.com/blog/2019/3/7/what-would-a-feminist-neighbourhood-look-like). In doing so, I collected lots of articles and read about loads of women in the industry. Below are the articles I read and a list of women you should know.
