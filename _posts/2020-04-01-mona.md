I have been reading Mona Eltahawy's the 7 necessary sins for women and girls. Mona's intersectional feminism is so bold, its inspiring. Today in twitter she reminds us that: social distancing is a privilege that many can not afford, and that if this is your first disaster, _you are privileged_. The urges us to remember that these times are re-traumatising for many.
