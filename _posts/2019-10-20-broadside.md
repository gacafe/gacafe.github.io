Attended [Broadside2019](https://broadside.wheelercentre.com/watch) and had an absolute blast + bought too many books.
I have a lot of notes to bring into here - and will do so when I get some time. In the mean time....




Here are some graphic recordings of some sessions by [Sarah Firth](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahthefirth_graphicrecording-broadside2019-feminism-activity-6599404422667874304-X0Vy).
