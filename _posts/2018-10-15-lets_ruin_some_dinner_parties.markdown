[Julie Lalonde](http://yellowmanteau.com/) tell us:

“Feminism is inherently hopeful, by working to end violence against women, I am inherently optimistic that a better world is possible that not all men are predators and waiting, that women do have great strength and resilience to do great things in the world. I think the world can change, but you don’t. And I’m the disruptor, I am the cranky one.”

“But if we are in every single space, you are not going to be the only person saying those things. You are setting a new norm in those places.”
