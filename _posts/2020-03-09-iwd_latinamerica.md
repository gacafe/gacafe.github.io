On IWD women all across Latin America protested our society and our governments for being complacent and silent to the violence against women: 2019 was one of the bloodiest, for Mexico, in terms of women murdered feminicidio ~80k women showed up to the protest - a feminist , angry, and powerful image from afar - I can barely imagine the energy that was flowing through those crowds, I was sad to miss it.
On March 9th women across Mexico demonstrated what a Mexico without women would be like - [those who were able to partake in the protest] didn't show up for work, didn't go out on the streets, did nothing.
