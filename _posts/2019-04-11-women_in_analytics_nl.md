I have been following [Cathy O'Neil](https://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg) since around 2015 when I was introduced to [her blog](https://mathbabe.org/) by a colleague at the time. 

Her talk at the [Women in Analytics Conference](https://womeninanalytics.com/) was really inspiring. I  about this [in twitter](https://twitter.com/GalaCF/status/1109085663721345024?s=20) but here are my highlights. 

- People trust AI because people trust math - she wrote Weapons of Math Destruction because she thought: "what would it look like to put the science into data science?"
- Math, AI and algorithms is not something we need to intimidate people with 
- In models, we have to define what success looks like - people who are in power get to define it, we have white guys hiding behind the authority of mathematics, algorithms of math destruction are widespread, mysterious, destructive 
- "These algorithms donâ€™t just fail for the people they harm, they fail their underlying mission" 
- Algorithms cause damage when they are used to punish - they could be used as a way to empower people, to help people, but they are instead being used negatively-- use them to help with poverty, with health... 
- Just because the algorithm is less accurate does not mean its less fair - fairness has to do with the way it is used.
- The people who are affected want to know: "are my civil rights being violated?"
